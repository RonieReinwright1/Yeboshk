My name is Ronie Reinwright. I would prefer to be called Ronie(ONE N). I do, or at least, I'm trying to do many things.

My main interests are foreign languages, drawing, creating music, cooking, coding, writing, reading, and more. I'm bad at everything here, except for cooking, and I guess, languages. My main focus is art. Then, after that, comes music. Although, as of right now, I'm not really working with music all that much.

I love translation and foreign languages. Currently, I can only do [EN to RU], or [RU to EN]. Though, unfortunately, I'm really busy these days, and many other things tend to take up my time instead. But do get in touch with me. Perhaps, I will be able to help.
